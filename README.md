## 🔖 Description : 
This repositories [whoishayyan.app](https://github.com/rheyhannh/whoishayyan.app) are migrated version from previous [whoishayyan](https://github.com/rheyhannh/whoishayyan) and handle Frontend stuff. 

## ❗  Problem in previous repositories : 
- Only using Express.js as backend and frontend to render pure HTML, CSS and Javascript pages code
- Static data, need to deploy application every data changes
- Bad benchmark results in Core Web Vitals

## 🚀 Improvements from previous repositories: 
- Seperating the Backend and Frontend stuff
- Using Express.js only for Backend stuff (details: [hayyan.server](https://github.com/rheyhannh/hayyan.server))
- Dynamic data, only need to use API Endpoint in server to get or update data in database
- Using React, Next.js for Frontend stuff
- Bundling the code using Webpack
- Using browser local storage to save current new data
- Improve benchmark results in Core Web Vitals
- The rest should be the same, if there is anything different it will be mentioned in a further release
